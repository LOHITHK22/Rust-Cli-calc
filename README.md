This Rust application, cli-calc, is a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It uses the Clap crate to manage user input, allowing users to specify operations and operands via command-line arguments. 
The program includes robust error handling, ensuring that invalid input, missing operands, and division by zero are properly managed. 
It also supports flags to print version information and app details. 
Additionally, the project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate each operation and handle edge cases like division by zero, demonstrating a well-rounded implementation of a CLI tool in Rust.
